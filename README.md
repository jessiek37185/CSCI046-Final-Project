Our project addressed the inefficiencies of outdated library management systems, such as slow checkouts, manual errors, and limited search capabilities. We developed a 
modernized system that automates core operations, including check-in, check-out, reservations, and inter-library searches. To achieve this, we implemented hash tables for 
constant-time book and user lookup, queues for fair and efficient reservation handling, stacks for managing multi-library organizations, and singly linked lists to maintain borrowing 
history in chronological order. These data structures were chosen for their efficiency, predictability, and scalability. The resulting system provided real-time availability tracking, 
automatic book reassignment upon return, and seamless inter-library sharing. It significantly reduced user wait times, improved accuracy, and enhanced the overall experience for both 
users and librarians.
